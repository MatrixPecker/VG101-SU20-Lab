  > The day of the debriefing has arrived. There are probably a lot of people in the room and countless thoughts swimming around in your head.
  >
  > Once you welcome people into the room and set expectations about the mindset they should be in for the duration of the meeting (blameless), as well as the outcome they can expect to walk away with (learning), there’s really only one thing for you to focus on: discovering the story behind the story. That is your north star.

### Tips

- This course mainly focuses on the correctness of your code; you are not expected to improve the efficiency of code.
- Every error (mostly in red) means something is wrong. Fix it even when the outputs are sometimes right.
- Every warning (mostly in yellow) means something is potentially wrong. Make sure you understand why it is warning you.
- Please be aware that a program which is right sometimes and wrong the other time, is wrong.
- Learn to use Search Engine
  - try to use **Google / Bing** instead of Baidu
