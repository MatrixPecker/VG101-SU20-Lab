Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.50,00:02:58.19,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,algorithms can get to the same final result, like sorting a random set of numbers into

Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.19,00:03:05.49,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,order, but some algorithms are much more efficient than others, this is studied in O(n) complexity.

Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.49,00:03:09.12,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Information theory studies the properties of information and how it can be measured,

Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.32,00:03:14.14,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,stored and communicated. One application of this is how well you can compress data, making

Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.29,00:04:13.38,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,CPU. When you are doing lots of different things at the same time, the CPU needs to

Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.38,00:04:17.56,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,switch back and forth between these jobs to make sure everything gets done in a reasonable

Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.56,00:04:22.29,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,time. This is controlled by a scheduler, which chooses what to do when and tries to get through

Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.29,00:04:27.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the tasks in the most efficient way, which can be very difficult problem.

Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.07,00:04:31.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Multiprocessing helps speed things up because the CPU has several cores that can execute

Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.60,00:04:37.16,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,multiple jobs in parallel. But this makes the job of the scheduler even more complex.

Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.38,00:05:01.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,using many different programming languages. A programming language is how humans tell

Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.10,00:05:05.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,a computer what to do and they vary greatly depending on the job at hand from low level

Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.91,00:05:28.22,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,raw CPU instructions and this is done by one or several programs called compilers.

Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.22,00:05:31.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Designing programming languages and compilers is a big deal, because they are the tool that
