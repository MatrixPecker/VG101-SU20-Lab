3. If the boundary case is wrong, normally your codes has some issues so except from the 1 point,

(As the solution to this exercise is very short, we will not give partial points for some wrong solutions)
 
Notes:
1. Cases: If all cases are right, can get full mark.
2. If fail cases, cases count for 70% percent, and he can get scores based. casesåˆ†
3. If you use recursion but fail to use `||` to 
4. If you codes has expressed conditions of `x+y` `x-y` you can get 5 points.
5. If you print 0/1 for all cases, though you can get 5 cases right no points will be given.
