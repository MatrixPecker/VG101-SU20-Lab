# VG101-SU20 Mid2 Ex3
*TA in charge: CHR*

Total score: 25
Test case score: 18
Total count of test cases: 9

Partial points that you may get (for those who only pass few/none cases:)
1. If the codes has shown concepts of chasing or passing through, you can get 3 points.
2. If the codes has correctly shown some concepts of going through the linklist, 2 points can be added.
3. If the codes has use concepts of slow and fast pointers, can get 2 points.

(As the solution to this exercise is very short, we will not give partial points for some wrong solutions)

Possible Deduction:
1. If you print true or false only, although some cases can be passed, you will get zero scores.
2. If you include a main function, resulting error in JOJ, you can get at most 20 points if the other parts of the solution is right.
