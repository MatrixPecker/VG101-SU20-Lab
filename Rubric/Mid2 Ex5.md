*TA in charge: WQH*

Total score: 15
Testcase score: 7
Total count of testcases: 20
Partial credits: 8

Notes:
- If your program passes more than one-third of the final testcases, you automatically get full marks for the partial credits
- If you only output `true` or `false`, or that you output them randomly, you get 0 marks for the testcase.
